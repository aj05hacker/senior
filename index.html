    <h2><b>   To dear My seniors,</b></h2>
    <div class="quotes"> <b>
      As this year comes to an end,
      My heart is filled with memories we've penned.
      You've been more than just friends, you're family,
      And I miss you dearly, so deeply.</b></p>
      <b>
      <p>Through laughter, tears, and countless talks,
      You've been there, supporting us, just like that.
      The moments we shared will forever remain,
      Etched in my heart, relieving the pain.</p>
      
      <p>You've shown us the way, guided us right,
      With your wisdom and love shining bright.
      Each day spent together was a true treasure,
      Leaving behind a void that's hard to measure.</p>
      
      <p>But as you embark on new paths, reaching new heights,
      Know that you're cherished, surrounded by lights.
      Though distance may keep us physically apart,
      Our bond and memories live on in my heart.</p>
      
      <p>Farewell, my dear seniors, as you soar high,
      Spread your wings, reach for the sky.
      Remember, we'll always be here, cheering you on,
      With love and admiration that will never be gone.</p>
      
      <p>I miss you, my friends, more than words can express,
      But the moments we shared, I'll forever caress.
      Thank you for being the best companions,
      Until we meet again, sending my affection.</p></b>
